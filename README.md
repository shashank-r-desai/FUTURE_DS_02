# Customer Retention & Churn Analysis (Task 2)

This project analyzes customer churn behavior for a subscription-based business using Python and Power BI.  
The goal is to identify churn patterns, key retention drivers, and actionable insights to reduce customer loss.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze customer churn distribution and trends
- Understand the impact of tenure, contracts, and payment methods on churn
- Perform exploratory data analysis using Python
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## Dataset
- IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
- Records: ~7,000 customers

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and feature engineering in Python
2. Export of cleaned dataset for visualization
3. Exploratory data analysis in Python and Power BI
4. Interactive dashboard creation in Power BI
5. Insight generation and business recommendations

## Key Insights
- Highest churn occurs in the early customer tenure period
- Month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn
- Customers using electronic check payment methods churn more frequently
- Churn decreases as customer tenure increases

## Outcome
This project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow, combining technical analysis with business-oriented insights, suitable for real-world decision-making.
